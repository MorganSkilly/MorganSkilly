## 🎬 Current Focus

I’m developing real-time, procedural, driving plate environments for LED volumes, with a strong focus on:

- 🚗 **Procedural road systems** using Houdini and UE5
- 🧩 **Custom tools** for content generation and VP pipelines
- 🎥 **Virtual Production-ready assets** optimized for nDisplay workflows
- 🕴 **Motion capture** for live and pre-recorded use
- 🧵 **Performance-aware tech art** across C++, Python, and Blueprints

## 🔧 Toolset

| Area | Tools |
|------|-------|
| Engine | Unreal Engine 5 (Blueprints, C++, nDisplay) |
| Procedural | Houdini (HDA pipelines) |
| Scripting | C++, C#, Python |
| Mocap Systems | Vicon, Mo-Sys, retargeting pipelines |
