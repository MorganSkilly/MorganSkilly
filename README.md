## 🎬 Current Focus

I’m developing real-time driving plate environments for LED volumes, with a strong focus on:

- 🚗 **Procedural road systems** using Houdini and UE5
- 🧩 **Custom tools** for camera layout, projection, and scene control
- 🎥 **Virtual Production-ready assets** optimized for nDisplay workflows
- 🕴 **Motion capture integration** for live and pre-recorded use
- 🧵 **Performance-aware tech art** across C++, Python, and Blueprints

## 🔧 Toolset

| Area | Tools |
|------|-------|
| Engine | Unreal Engine 5 (Blueprints, C++, nDisplay) |
| Procedural | Houdini (HDA pipelines, PDG) |
| Scripting | Python (tooling, automation), C++ |
| Mocap | Vicon systems, retargeting pipelines |
| ML/Support | PyTorch, Git, ShotGrid |

## 🧰 Projects

- **nDisplayMeshTool**  
  Unreal Engine plugin to generate mesh layouts for LED volumes from CSV configs.

- **Real-time Driving Plates** *(MSc Project)*  
  Procedural Houdini-UE5 toolchain for fast, scalable road scenes used in VP stage simulation.

- **Moiré Pattern Classifier**  
  CNN-based pipeline for detecting LED moiré artifacts in rendered frames.
