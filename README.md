## ðŸš§ What Iâ€™m Working On

Iâ€™m focused on developing real-time virtual production workflows using **Unreal Engine** and **LED volumes**, with an emphasis on making environments **art-directable and flexible** on stage.

### ðŸŽ“ MSc Project: [Realtime Roads](https://github.com/Realtime-Roads-Team)
I am the **sole developer** of this toolset and system for the **real-time generation of driving environments** â€” a modern alternative to traditional 2D driving plates.

This approach removes the need for multi-camera plate capture and enables:
- Live scene adjustments during takes
- Flexible layout and lighting changes without re-rendering
- Greater creative control for stage and content teams

Procedural assets are generated in **Houdini**, while environment layout is handled using **Unreal Engine's** built-in systems and **PCG framework**.

## ðŸ§ª Motion Capture & VP Tech

As part of my MSc research, Iâ€™ve worked with advanced virtual production and mocap technologies:

- **Vicon**: Experimental motion capture with passive markers and live tracking
- **Facial Mocap**: MetaHuman Live Link Face integration
- **Camera Tracking**: Mo-Sys StarTracker for in-camera VFX
- **Custom Approaches**: Retroreflective paint for flexible marker setups in unconventional spaces

## ðŸ›  Tools & Tech Stack

- **Unreal Engine 5** (C++ & Blueprints)
- **Houdini** (procedural asset development)
- **Mo-Sys**, **Vicon**
- **Brompton Technology** (LED processing)
- **SMPTE 2110 / Rivermax**, **Genlock**, and live sync systems

## ðŸŽ¯ Career Focus

I'm working towards roles in **virtual production supervision** or **technical direction**, with a focus on:
- Real-time environment and content development for LED stages
- Bridging creative and technical workflows on set
- Scalable tools that empower virtual production teams
